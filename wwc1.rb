puts "I #{verb} to the sandwich shop across the street for lunch
yesterday. I go there at least #{number} times a week. They have the best
Philly Cheesesteak, full of #{pnoun} and #{pnoun1} and gooey,
stringy #{noun1}. They prepare it just right, #{ending_verb} it
until the meat breaks up and browns, but is still #{adjective} and juicy.
Then they add special #{pnoun2} and place two pieces of delicious #{color}
provolone cheese on top of the meat. As soon as it melts, they scoop the
whole thing up and plop it on a #{adverb} toasted bun.  The juice #{verbs}
into the bread and runs down your #{bpart} when you bite
into it. Perfect! My mouth was watering just thinking about it. I #{adverb1}
placed my order, dreaming of my Cheesesteak sandwich. As soon as it was ready, I
#{pverb} back to my office and settled down to savor every mouth
watering bite.  But, wouldn't you know, they'd given me a #{noun1} on rye
instead!"
